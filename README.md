Homework 1
The purpose of this assignment was to refactor code for an existing webpage (Horiseon) for coding simplicity or to make it "dry", to make it accessible and improve Search Engine Optimization (SEO).  The refactored code should also provide for long-term sustainability.
I initially started off by changing appropriate <div> tags to section appropriate tags, eg. <header>, <section> and <footer> to better segment code by box area on the webpage. I also provided accessability descriptors for images using "alt" commands/tags.
