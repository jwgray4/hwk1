Homework 1
The purpose of this assignment was to refactor code for an existing webpage (Horiseon) for coding simplicity or to make it "dry", to make it accessible and improve Search Engine Optimization (SEO).  The refactored code should also provide for long-term sustainability. I initially started off by changing appropriate <div> tags to section appropriate tags, eg. <header>, <section> and <footer> to better segment code by box area on the webpage. I also provided accessability descriptors for images using "alt" commands/tags. I learned how to segment sections of code for easier reading by other developers, how to consolidate style elements where possible if they have the same attributes. Since the assignment was to refactor (and not change code), I learned to make the aforementioned changes without changing the webpage design (one of the points of the homework exercise). I have not fully gained a good understanding of the "git"/"github" process, but hope to improve as I complete more classwork and challenges.
